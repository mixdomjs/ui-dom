## uiDom

uiDom is a state based DOM rendering library in JavaScript/TypeScript. It provides a framework for building user interfaces all the way up to complex application with several laterally interrelated parts - using integrated contexts with their data and actions (and questions). It's lightweight, performant and with a flexible architecture to fit various different circumstances. Get the most out of uiDom by using a JSX compiler and TypeScript - everything is typed.
